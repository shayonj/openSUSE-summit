<p>Today, openSUSE supports two distinct (and conflictig) approaches
for the configuration and management of network interfaces.

You can either use the "traditional" sysconfig based approach with the
ifup/ifdown command line utilities, or you can use NetworkManager.
Both have their pros and cons, but neither is really designed to cover all
use cases well. At the same time, we're faced with a lot of challenges, as
the requirements on network configuration get more complex. IPv6 has been
around for a while now, but doing it Right[tm] requires a much more flexible
and dyamic approach to interface management than we support today. Beyond
that, virtualization creates a whole new set of problems, with virtual
interfaces getting created and torn down on the fly, and with management
facilities like libvirt or openvswitch that are hard to reconcile with either
of the existing methods.</p>
</ br>
<p>To address these issues, we would like to propose a unified, layered
management framework for network interfaces. Some code for this exists
today, and we are looking into getting this accepted for the next
release of openSUSE. We would like to use the talk to discuss the design
with the community, present the current state of the project and gather
feedback and suggestions.</p>
